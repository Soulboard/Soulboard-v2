# Oracle Integration Summary - Profile Page

## ðŸŽ¯ Changes Made to Profile Page

### 1. **Real-time Stats Dashbo### ðŸ“ˆ **Key Calculations**
- **Earnings Formula**: `views Ã— 0.0001` SOL (simplified from taps-based calculation)
- **Daily aggregation** from ThingSpeak feed data with earnings calculation
- **Device performance averaging** across all connected devices
- **Focus on views-to-earnings conversion** for cleaner metrics: Mock static data (127 devices, 1847.32 SOL)
- **After**: Live oracle data with 3 key metrics:
  - **Devices Connected**: Real device feed count from oracle
  - **Total Views**: Aggregated views from all device feeds
  - **Total Earnings**: Calculated based on views only (0.0001 SOL per view)

### 2. **Performance Chart Enhancement**
- **Before**: Static mock data showing campaign activity
- **After**: Dynamic 14-day performance chart showing:
  - Daily views (blue area) and earnings (green area) from ThingSpeak API
  - Dual Y-axis chart with views on left, earnings on right
  - Real-time data processed from last 30 ThingSpeak entries

### 3. **ThingSpeak Integration Status**
- **New Feature**: Live integration status panel showing:
  - Channel ID (2890626)
  - Last entry ID
  - Total views and taps
  - Live status indicator with green pulse

### 4. **Enhanced Campaign Cards**
- **New Feature**: Each campaign now shows:
  - **Live Performance Metrics** per campaign
  - **Views and Earnings** calculated from oracle data
  - **Simplified 2-column layout** focusing on key metrics

### 5. **Oracle Health Monitoring**
- **New Feature**: Oracle status indicator in header
  - Green pulsing dot when oracle is online
  - Red dot when oracle is offline
  - "Oracle Online/Offline" status text

### 6. **Enhanced Refresh System**
- **Before**: Only refreshed campaign data
- **After**: "Refresh All" button that updates:
  - Campaign data
  - All device feeds
  - ThingSpeak data
  - Channel feed data

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow Integration

### Oracle Data Sources
```typescript
// Live device feeds
const allDeviceFeeds = api.oracle.getAllDeviceFeeds.useQuery();

// ThingSpeak API data (last 30 entries)
const thingSpeakData = api.oracle.getThingSpeakData.useQuery({ results: 30 });

// Channel feed data
const channelFeed = api.oracle.getChannelFeed.useQuery();
```

### Performance Calculations
```typescript
// Real stats calculation
const realStats = {
  devicesConnected: allDeviceFeeds.statistics.totalFeeds,
  totalViews: allDeviceFeeds.statistics.totalViews,
  totalTaps: allDeviceFeeds.statistics.totalTaps,
  totalCollected: (totalViews * 0.00001) + (totalTaps * 0.005), // Estimated earnings
  averageViewsPerDevice: totalViews / devicesConnected,
  averageTapsPerDevice: totalTaps / devicesConnected,
};
```

### Chart Data Processing
```typescript
// Convert ThingSpeak feeds to daily chart data
const chartData = thingSpeakData.feeds.reduce((acc, feed) => {
  const date = new Date(feed.createdAt).toLocaleDateString();
  acc[date] = {
    date,
    views: acc[date]?.views + feed.views || feed.views,
    taps: acc[date]?.taps + feed.taps || feed.taps,
  };
  return acc;
}, {});
```

## ðŸ”„ Loading States & Error Handling

### Enhanced Loading
- Shows loading for both campaigns and oracle data
- Displays appropriate loading messages
- Graceful fallbacks when oracle data unavailable

### Real-time Updates
- Data freshness timestamps
- Auto-refresh capabilities
- Oracle connectivity status

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Enhancements
- **4-column stats grid** instead of 2-column
- **Color-coded metrics**: Blue (views), Orange (taps), Green (earnings)
- **Live status indicators** with pulsing animations
- **Performance cards** in each campaign with CTR calculations

### Interactive Elements
- **Refresh All button** with activity icon
- **Oracle status indicator** in header
- **Estimated earnings** in campaign performance cards
- **Data timestamps** for freshness awareness

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics Now Displayed

### Global Stats
1. **Devices Connected** - Live device feed count
2. **Total Views** - Aggregated from all devices
3. **Total Earnings** - Views-based calculation (0.0001 SOL per view)

### Per-Campaign Stats
1. **Views** - Campaign-specific view count
2. **Earnings** - Campaign-specific earnings based on views

### Chart Data
1. **14-day performance trend** - Daily views and earnings
2. **ThingSpeak integration** - Live API data with earnings calculation
3. **Dual Y-axis chart** - Views (left) and earnings (right) for better visualization

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Integration

### For Users
- **Real performance data** instead of mock numbers
- **Live earnings tracking** based on actual device performance
- **Campaign optimization insights** through CTR and performance metrics
- **Data transparency** with freshness indicators

### For System
- **Oracle health monitoring** - Know when data source is down
- **Performance tracking** - Monitor device and campaign effectiveness
- **Earnings calculation** - Automated based on real performance
- **Data synchronization** - Multiple oracle endpoints working together

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### React Hooks Integration
```typescript
// Multiple oracle queries for comprehensive data
const { data: allDeviceFeeds, isLoading: loadingOracle, refetch: refetchOracle } = 
  api.oracle.getAllDeviceFeeds.useQuery();

const { data: thingSpeakData, refetch: refetchThingSpeak } = 
  api.oracle.getThingSpeakData.useQuery({ results: 30 });

const { data: channelFeed, refetch: refetchChannel } = 
  api.oracle.getChannelFeed.useQuery();
```

### Performance Optimization
- **useMemo** for expensive calculations
- **Conditional rendering** to avoid unnecessary computations
- **Error boundaries** for graceful oracle data failures
- **Loading states** for better user experience

The profile page now provides a comprehensive, real-time view of device performance and earnings, making it a powerful dashboard for campaign management and performance monitoring! ðŸŽ‰
